Problem2.C: The Diffusion Limited Aggregation problem (DLA) is about particles performing random walks in order to form aggregates of such particles. 
The clusters formed in a DLA process are an example of fractals, structures that appear to be the same at different scales. 
Firstly, the process of DLA is performed in order to develop an aggregate of particles that perform random walks.  
In the second part of the problem, the fractal dimension is calculated, which shows how the number of particles in a structure changes
with the scale at which it is measured. 
In this problem, the ROOT package (CERN software) is used for demonstration. After running this simulation, one can see the canvas above 
that creates the DLA structure.
